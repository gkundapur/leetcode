https://leetcode.com/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=array

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.
There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to 
prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.

Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.

Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
Output: [9,0,1,6]
